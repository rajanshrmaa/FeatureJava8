1. Java Multithreading Tutorial
What:
Multithreading allows multiple threads (smallest unit of a process) to run concurrently,
enabling parallel execution.

When:
Use when you want to perform multiple tasks at the same timeâ€”e.g., background tasks,
animations, or handling multiple client requests.

Where:
In applications like games, servers, or any performance-critical real-time systems.

How:
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running...");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread t1 = new MyThread();
        t1.start();
    }
}
